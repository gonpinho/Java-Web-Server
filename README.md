# Java-Web-Server

In the 8th week of the bootcamp, we had the opportunity to develop a webserver in Java from scratch. This was an exercise to implement I/O reading and writting (InputStreams and OutputStreams), networking (TCP and Sockets) and the newly learned concept of Multi-threading. 
NetCat and Chrome Developer Tools were used as an aid to test the webserver.
